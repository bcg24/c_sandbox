So basically what we have is a sound sampled at whatever the sample rate is
that gives us an fft of equal length
The DFT is mirrored about the nyquist frequency
That means that it is trying to read frequencies
up to one cycle per period, which is very well mighty be alliased
If our sample rate is 48000 Hz for example, then 10
seconds of recording would be 480000 samples,
Therefore, the discrete fourier transform
has 480000 discrete levels at which it can
express the frequency composition of the signal
beteen 0.1 Hz and 48000 Hz, but we have
to throw the top half out

X_k​=∑(​x_n*​e^(−i2πkn/N), n=0,N−1)

where N is the number of samples, n is the index, and k is the signal number,
which corresponds to a 


We can think of the dft as 

[x_1, x_2, ..., x_n]*[[e^(−i2π0n/N)]', [e^(−i2π1n/N)]', ..., [e^(−i2π(n/N)]'], for

e^(-i*x) = cos(x)+i*sin(x)

k = 0 cycle per seconds
k = 1 

can identify up to 4 cycles per window
